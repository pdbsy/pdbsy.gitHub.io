                <br/>
               <br> In a tarot card reading
               <br> A asks "Are you open
               <br> to love? Are you keeping love in mind?"
                <br/>
                <br> Amoo, I think.
                <br> Amoo.
                <br> The word a moan
                <br/>
                <br> a blown kiss
                <br> the soft things it makes a mouth do.
                <br>  Amoo, I thought
                <br/>
                <br> as he told me about the Page of Cups,
                <br> the echo of what
                <br> I've never called you.</p>

                 pressing your eyesocket
                 to the viewfinder
                 of a bazooka
                 crouched as you balance
                 the metal tube on your shoulder
                 in one you guide a belt of ammo
                 into the untiring weapon
                 proud
                 your elbow out as if
                 mid-waltz
                 your frame strong
                 and lightly supporting the gun
                 a kind of smile

                 looking nearly as he does—
                 closest to himself then
                 as he could be, just learning
                 how to lean into his new body.
                 He suspends there
                 by standing order,
                 a spreading fire in his chest,
                 his groin. He is on stage
                 for us to see him, see him?
                 He stands in the noontime sun."/>

                 the things she does not

                 tipped arrow, she told
                 classmates at recess,
                 to the neck, hollow whistle
                 
                 of it launched
                 from a blowgun
                 cutting the air between them.
                 
                 According to most
                 definitions, I have never
                 been at war.
                 
                 According to mine,
                 most of my life
                 spent there. Anthrax
                 
                 in salt and pepper shakers,
                 patrol car windshields
                 with crosshairs painted over them,
                 
                 some badge holding
                 my father's pocket contents
                 up to him and asking
                 
                 where the cash is from.
                 The war in Iraq, I read,
                 is over now.
                 
                 The last wheels gathering
                 into themselves
                 as they lift off
                 
                 the sad tarmac. I say
                 begin. I say end
                 and you are to believe
                 
                 this is what happens.
                 I say chew 40 times
                 before swallowing, slime,
                 
                 and you go home to mother,
                 press a dog tag to your temple,
                 press a gun to that,
                 
                 the tag flowering
                 into your skull. Thank God
                 for all-weather floor mats
                 
                 and the slope of my personal driveway
                 and beer cans that change
                 color to let me know
                 
                 they are cold enough.

                 smelling of iron and Axe body spray.
                 
                 In 2003, a man held a fistful
                 of blood and brains to a PBS camera
                 and yelled
                 
                 is this the freedom
                 they want for us? It was from his friend's
                 head. They were marching
                 
                 as they figured Americans do.
                 Between them, hardly three horsepower
                 and still we shot him.
                 
                 We say the war is over, but still
                 the woman leans across
                 the passenger seat
                 
                 my son, my son.
                 I wasn't there
                 so I can't know, can I?"/>
