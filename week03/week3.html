        <h1 style="color:#f4abac; font-size:20px">"Ways of Seeing," a book written by John Berger in the 1970s. In this book, Berger challenges the notion that visual experience is innocent, and argues that the way we see things is influenced by cultural, social, and political factors. Berger particularly focuses on how men and women are represented in visual culture, and how these representations impact their self-perception and behavior.

          One of the key ideas in "Ways of Seeing" is the concept of the "male gaze," which refers to the way in which women are often depicted in visual culture as objects of male desire. Berger argues that this creates a power dynamic that reinforces traditional gender roles and objectifies women. He also notes that women can internalize these representations and come to see themselves as objects, rather than as active agents in the world.
          
          Overall, I think that "Ways of Seeing" remains an important and influential work in the field of visual culture, and its insights into the cultural and political dimensions of how we see and are seen continue to be relevant today.</h1>
